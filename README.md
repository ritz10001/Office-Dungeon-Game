# Office-Dungeon-Game

My First attempt to get into the world of game development. Office Dungeon is a basic 3D game based on escape rooms. It contains three levels, and the difficulty ramps up after each level. The player has a designated amount of time to find a path to escape the office. More info is available in the "context" button under the options menu. 

More levels may/may not be added in the future. Enjoy!

Here are some sneak peak pics of how the game looks like!
